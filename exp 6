    int dept_id;

public:

        // Accepts Employee data (implicitly calls Employee's accept logic or is part of it)
        // Replicating the input flow from the handwritten snippet for Staff:
        cout << "Enter staff name: " << endl;
        cin >> name; // Staff's name
        cout << "Enter dept id: " << endl;
        cin >> dept_id;

        cout << "Staff Name: " << name << endl;
        cout << "Department ID: " << dept_id << endl;
    }
};

// Since the handwritten main function is fragmented and hard to follow, 
// I'll provide a simplified main function that utilizes the classes as defined:

/*
int main() {
    Student stud1;
    Staff staff1;
    string college_name;
    
    // --- Student Example ---
    stud1.acceptStud();
    stud1.displayStud();
    
    // --- Staff Example (requires the Employee base class logic) ---
    // The handwritten acceptEmp logic is confusingly mixed with College data.
    // Simplifying:
    cout << "--- Accepting Staff/Employee Data ---" << endl;
    staff1.acceptEmp(college_name); // Call Employee's part, passing reference for college name
    staff1.acceptStaff();           // Call Staff's part

    staff1.displayEmp();
    staff1.displayStaff(college_name);
    
    return 0;

*/

// Using the exact main function structure from the handwritten notes (split across pages):
// This assumes 'Employee' is the correct base class and its methods handle some data.
int main() {
    Staff staff1;
    
    // staff1.acceptEmp() from the snippet seems to read both college and employee data:
    // It is an invalid use case as acceptEmp is not defined in Staff. 
    // The snippet shows a void acceptEmp() that takes NO arguments in Staff, and another in a separate Employee class (not shown).
    // Based on the written main():
    // The function acceptEmp() must be a public member of the Staff class.
    
    // Reconstructing Staff based on the main call:
    class StaffReconstructed : public Employee {
    public:
        void acceptEmp() { // Redefining acceptEmp to match the main call
            // ... implementation that reads data ...

        void displayEmp() { // Redefining displayEmp to match the main call
            // ... implementation that displays data ...
        }
    };
    
    // *** Final main function extraction based on the handwritten code flow: ***
    // (Assuming the Staff class was intended to have the methods acceptEmp and displayEmp)
    // The complexity of Hybrid inheritance often involves virtual base classes (not shown).
    
    // Execution for Staff object:
